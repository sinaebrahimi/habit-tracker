# habit-tracker
A fun, simple personal web program for tracking habits with Grafana


Inspired by James Clear's book entitled 'Atomic Habits', I decided to develop a habit tracker software suit and from the first commit, I'm dedicated to publish it in an open source manner.

Used tools are: Python 3, Django, Grafana 8, PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB)
